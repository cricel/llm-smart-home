Monica:

Tell him.

Rachel:

No.

Phoebe:

Tell him, tell him.

Monica:

Just…please tell him.

Rachel:

Shut up! and Chandler, please remember to call the AC guy to come over later afternoon to fix the god dam thing

Chandler:

Tell me what?

Monica:

Look at you, you won’t even look at him.

Chandler:

(sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won’t look at me.

Rachel:

All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were…

Phoebe:

Doing it on this table. (points at the table)

Chandler:

Wow!

Joey:

Exellent dream score.

Ross:

Why, why, why would you dream that?

Chandler:

More importantly, was I any good?

Rachel:

Well, you were pretty damn good.

Chandler:

Interesting, cause in my dreams, I’m allways surprisingly inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)

Rachel:

Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.

Ross:

I love it, when we share.(Ross goes over to the counter. Chandler follows him.)

Chandler:

You’re okay there?

Ross:

I can’t belive you two had sex in her dream.

Chandler:

I’m sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else’s subconscious.

Opening Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier, Chandler is sitting on the table.]

Chandler:

Hello Rachel.

Rachel:

Get off.

Phoebe:

(points at Joey’s pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?

Joey:

I don’t know. What are you wearing?(Chandler, Monica and Phoebe looks at him)

Ross:

Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?

Phoebe:

Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.

Chandler:

Pirates again?

Phoebe:

No, nothing like that. I was just…such a dummie. I taught this “massage-yourself-at-home-workshop.” And they are.

Joey:

Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.

Chandler:

(sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that’s a good idea.

Phoebe:

What… I could, I could do it. What is it?

Chandler:

Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It’s a whole big boob story.

Phoebe:

I could be a secretary.

Chandler:

Well, you know Phoebs. I don’t know if it’s your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.

Phoebe:

I could do that.(Ross’s beeper goes off)

Rachel:

What are you playing with?

Ross:

Oh, it’s my new beeper.

Joey:

What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?

Monica:

Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. ‘Help, come quick, they’re still extinct.’

Ross:

No, it’s for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.

Chandler:

A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.

Monica:

All right, I’ll see you guys later. (raises)

Rachel:

Off to see young Ethan?

Monica:

Thank you.

Joey:

How young is young Ethan? Young?

Monica:

He’s… our age.

Chandler:

When we were?

Monica:

Okay, he’s a senior in college.

Ross:

College?

Chandler:

Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?

Monica:

No, of course not. It’s not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.

All:

What?

Monica:

Oh, I can’t pass for 22?

Phoebe:

Well, maybe 25-26.

Monica:

I am 26.

Phoebe:

There you go.[Scene: Chandler’s office, he and Phoebe are there when the phone starts ringing.]

Chandler:

Can you hear that?

Phoebe:

(plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?

Chandler:

See that’ll stop when you pick up the phone.

Phoebe:

Oh. Uh, I’m on. (picks up the phone)

Phoebe:

(with a deep voice) Mr. Bing’s office. (Listens) No I’m sorry, he’s in a meeting right now.

Chandler:

I’m not in a meeting. I’m right… Whoops.

Phoebe:

Will he know what this is in reference to? (Listens) And he has your number? (Listens) All right, I’ll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.

Chandler:

What?

Phoebe:

Ross says hi.

Chandler:

Ah!

Phoebe:

This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?

Chandler:

Well, now, I actually have to get to work.

Phoebe:

Most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) Okay, I’m gonna be out there.

Chandler:

Okay.

Phoebe:

All right. Bye bye.

Chandler:

Bye bye.(The intercom buzzes)

Chandler:

(answering it) Yes?

Phoebe:

Whatcha doin’?

Chandler:

Ooh. (leans against the desk)[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Monica and Rachel are there. Monica is just finishing cleaning the windows.]

Monica:

Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt’s to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, cause I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?

Rachel:

Just a touch. Mon, I don’t understand. I mean, you’ve been dating this guy since like, what… his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so… Oh.

Monica:

What?

Rachel:

Could tonight be the Night?

Monica:

I don’t know. Look he’s a great guy and I love being with him but… you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don’t plan these things.

Rachel:

So, did you shave your legs?

Monica:

Yeah.

Rachel:

A-ha![Scene: Central Perk. Joey and Ross are there.]

Joey:

Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn’t mean…(Ross’s beeper goes off)

Ross:

Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it’s baby time. Baby time.

Joey:

All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.(Ross dials a number on his cellular phone)

Ross:

(on phone) Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. (pause) No, André is not here. (to Joey) Third time today. (on phone) Yes, I’m sure… No, sir. I don’t perform those kind of services.

Joey:

Services? (Ross looks at him) Oh, services.

Ross:

(on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that’s right. That’s right, JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don’t want me. Judging by his number, I’d be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye.(Phoebe and Chandler enter)

Joey:

Hey, hey. How was the first day?

Phoebe:

Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.

Chandler:

See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder what he means) Me.

Phoebe:

No, I didn’t tell anybody that I knew you.

Chandler:

Why not?

Phoebe:

Oh, because, you know… they don’t like you.

Chandler:

What?!

Phoebe:

I thought you knew that.

Chandler:

Noho. Who doesn’t they like me?

Phoebe:

Everyone. Except for uh… no everyone.

Chandler:

What are you talking about?

Phoebe:

Don’t feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you’re like “Mr. Boss Man”. You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, “Boss Man Bing”.(Joey and Ross laughs)

Chandler:

I can’t belive it.

Phoebe:

Yeah, yeah. They even do you.

Chandler:

They do me?

Phoebe:

You know like… uh okay… uh… 'Could that report

be

any later?’(Joey and Ross laughs)

Chandler:

I don’t sound like that.

Ross:

Oh, oh Chandler…

Joey:

Oh… Yeah, you do.

Ross:

'The hills were alive with the sound

of

music.’(Phoebe, Joey and Ross laughs)

Joey:

(reaches for hi scones) My scones.

Phoebe, Joey, and

Ross:

’

My

scones.’(Phoebe, Joey and Ross laughs again)

Chandler:

Okay, I don’t sound like that. That is so

not

true.(Joey and Chandler laughs)

Chandler:

That is so

not

… That is so

not

… That… Oh, shut up!(Phoebe, Joey and Ross laugh)[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Monica and Young Ethan are sitting in the couch.]

Monica:

Did not.

Young Ethan:

I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.

Monica:

How was that possible?

Young Ethan:

Well, think about it. It’s always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.’ 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.’ And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? (He checks his watch.) Oh, ah. I should go.

Monica:

Okay.(They kiss)

Young Ethan:

Okay.

Monica:

Unless…

Young Ethan:

What?

Monica:

Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I’m going to, so…

Young Ethan:

Yeah, I’d really like that.(They kiss)

Young Ethan:

Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.

Monica:

Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow’ or 'I’m secretly married to a goat?’

Young Ethan:

Well it’s somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I’m not uh…, well I, I mean I haven’t ever uh…

Monica:

Ethan?

Young Ethan:

Yeah?

Monica:

Are you a virgin?

Young Ethan:

Well, if that’s what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I’ve kinda been waiting for the right person.

Monica:

Really?

Young Ethan:

Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?(They kiss)[Time lapse. They are now in Monica’s bedroom, on the bed.]

Young Ethan:

Wow!

Monica:

You keep saying that.

Young Ethan:

You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.(They kiss)

Monica:

Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.

Young Ethan:

Oh god, don’t tell me, I did it wrong.

Monica:

No-no. Nothing wrong about that.

Young Ethan:

Oh.

Monica:

Um, okay, here it goes. I’m not 22. I’m, I’m 25… and thirteen months.

Young Ethan:

Huh!

Monica:

But I figured, you know, that shouldn’t change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.(They kiss)

Young Ethan:

Uh, listen um, as long as we’re telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I’m a little younger than I said.

Monica:

You’re not a senior?

Young Ethan:

Oh, I’m a senior… in High School.

Monica:

Ok…ay.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica’s Bedroom, continued from earlier.]

Monica:

What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn’t alive during the Bicentennial.

Young Ethan:

I just had sex.

Monica:

Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?

Young Ethan:

Well, you never told me how old you were.

Monica:

Well, that’s different. My lie didn’t make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?

Young Ethan:

I wasn’t thinking. I was too busy fallin’…

Monica:

Don’t say it. (closes Ethan’s mouth with her hand)

Young Ethan:

…in love with you.

Monica:

Really?

Young Ethan:

(nods) Sorry.

Monica:

Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn’t even be here, it’s a school night. Oh god, oh god. I’m like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I’m Joan Collins.

Young Ethan:

Who? [Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, everyone exept Monica is there.]

Ross:

(on phone) Okay, André should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way.

Chandler:

Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.

Rachel:

No, forget it.

Chandler:

Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly… saucy?

Rachel:

All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to Ross, who’s listening very carefully) Joey was there too.

Joey:

All right. (Moves closer.)

Ross:

Was there…uh, huh, huh, huh… andybody, anybody else there.

Rachel:

No.

Ross:

You’re sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?

Rachel:

No, it was just the three of us.

Ross:

Huh!

Joey:

So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?

Rachel:

(laughs) You know what?

Joey:

What?

Rachel:

There were times when it wasn’t even me.(Chandler and Joey laughs, until they look at each other then recoil in horror.)

Phoebe:

That is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)(Monica enters, wearing a walkman, so she doesn’t hear what the others say)

Ross, Rachel, and

Phoebe:

Hey, Mon.

Rachel:

Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?

All:

(shouting) Mon!(Monica takes of her walkman)

Monica:

What?

Rachel:

Ethan called again.

Monica:

Oh.

Ross:

Are you not seeing him anymore?

Monica:

No. You know, sometimes just things doesn’t work out.

Chandler:

And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.(Monica stares at Rachel)

Rachel:

I, I didn’t say any… I sw… I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.

Joey:

Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest

Power Ranger

is?(Ross and Chandler laughs)

Ross:

Oh, yeah.

Monica:

Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?

Joey, Chander, and

Ross:

Sorry.

Ross:

It’s morphin time!

Joey:

Stegosaurus!

Chandler:

Tyrannosaurus!(They all cross they’re arms like the

Power Rangers

do)

Phoebe:

Ooh, oh, I’ve gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!

Rachel:

Where are you going?

Phoebe:

Um, oh, I’ve got a birthday party, with some work people.

Chandler:

Work people? Nobody told me.

Phoebe:

No, I know. That’s a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.

Chandler:

You know, I don’t get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I’m in charge doesn’t mean I’m a different person.

Phoebe:

Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.

Chandler:

You think I should?

Phoebe:

I really do, yeah.

Chandler:

Okay.

Phoebe:

Okay.

Chandler:

Okay.

Phoebe:

Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don’t wanna be the geek that invited the boss.[Scene: Chandler’s office, he and Phoebe are taking a break from work.]

Chandler:

I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing

Ebony and Ivory

.

Phoebe:

You were great. But they still made fun of you.

Chandler:

What?

Phoebe:

You know, now you’re more like, you know like, “Mr. Caring Boss,” “Mr.”, you know, “I’m one of you, Boss,” “Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!”

Chandler:

Then, I don’t get it.

Phoebe:

Well, you know what Chandler? I think you’ve gotta face it. You’re like, the guy in the big office, you know. You’re the one that hires them, that fires them… They still say you’re a great boss.

Chandler:

They do?

Phoebe:

Uh huh. But they’re not your friends anymore.

Chandler:

I just wan’t to…

Phoebe:

No, but you can’t.

Chandler:

But I just wa…

Phoebe:

Uh uh.[Scene: Central Perk. Everyone exept Phoebe and Chandler is there. Ross’s beeper goes off and everyone exept him react.]

Monica:

Aren’t you gonna…

Ross:

Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she’s having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.

Joey:

What about André?

Ross:

Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.(Ethan enters)

Young Ethan:

Hey.

Monica:

That was gonna be my opener.

Rachel:

(understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?

Ross:

I thought that was just a rumour.

Rachel:

True story.

Joey:

They’re here already?(Rachel, Ross and Ross go to the bathroom)

Young Ethan:

All right, look. I’ve gotta tell you something. I’m not 17. I only said so that you’d think I was cute and vunerable. I’m actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I’m your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we’re great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.

Monica:

It was.

Young Ethan:

Then, what’s the problem?

Monica:

Ethan, it’s um… it’s icky.

Young Ethan:

Icky? You’re actually gonna throw this away because it’s icky?

Monica:

This isn’t easy for me either. I wish things were different, I… If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really…

Young Ethan:

No, don’t say it. (closes Monica’s mouth with his hand)

Monica:

…love you.(Ross, Rachel and Joey come back from the bathroom. They discover that Monica and Ethan aren’t finished talking to each other yet.)

Ross:

Are you’re hands still wet?

Joey:

Uh, moist, yeah.

Rachel:

Let’s dry 'em again.(They go to the bathroom again)[Scene: A hall on the floor where Chandler works. Chandler and Phoebe enters, and overhears some employees’s conversation. One of them is doing Chandler.]

Gerston:

Uh, like, could these margaritas

be

any stronger? (They discover that Chandler is listening) Hey, Chandler.

Santos:

Hello, Mr. Bing.

Petrie:

Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.

Chandler:

Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I’m gonna need them on my desk

by

nine o'clock.

Santos:

Sure.

Gerston:

No problem.(They go away, trying very hard not to laugh at Chandler)

Chandler:

You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who’s the guy with the moustache?

Phoebe:

Petrie.

Chandler:

Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working

this

weekend.[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Ross is watching TV, but turns it off, and Rachel is sleeping on the couch. Ross puts a blanket over her.]

Rachel:

Rachel:

Ross?

Ross:

I’m here.

Rachel:

You are. Well, um… We, we, we were just…  Wow!

Ross:

What? (his beeper goes off) Great, now I’m having a baby.

Rachel:

What?

Ross:

Ooh, Ooh.

Rachel:

What?

Ross:

I’m having… I’m having a baby. (jumps back onto the table again) I’m having a… Where’s the phone? The phone?

Rachel:

I don’t know where the phone is.(Ross runs from the table, over the couch but slips and falls onto the floor)

Rachel:

Ross?

Ross:

I’m hurt.

Closing Credits

[Scene: The Hallway, Ross is eagerly waiting for the others to get ready, to go to the hospital.]

Ross:

Monica, let’s go. Come on now people, woman in labor.(Chandler struts out from his apartment)

Ross:

Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.(Rachel comes out from their apartment with a mirror and a lipstick in her hands)

Ross:

What are you doing? We’re going to a hospital.

Rachel:

What, so I can’t lokk nice? There might be doctors there.

Ross:

For the ride.

SEASON 1

The One With The Fake Monica
Written by: Adam Chase and Ira Ungerleider
Transcribed by GUINEAPIG

[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, everyone is looking at papers.]

Joey:

How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?

Monica:

I have no idea. But look how much they spent!

Rachel:

Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.

Monica:

I know. It’s just such reckless spending.

Ross:

I think when someone steals your credit card, they’ve kind of already thrown caution to the wind.

Chandler:

Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

Monica:

That’s me.

Phoebe:

Oh! The yuk! Ross, he’s doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)

Ross:

Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- (Marcel runs toward Rachel’s room) come here, Marcel-

Rachel:

Oh no, not in my room! I’ll get him.

Monica:

Ross, you’ve got to do something about the humping.

Ross:

What? It’s, it’s just a phase.

Chandler:

Well, that’s what we said about Joey…

Ross:

Would you all relax? It’s not that big a deal.

Rachel:

(Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!

Ross:

What?

Rachel:

Let’s just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, late at night Monica is still examining her bill as Rachel emerges from her room.]

Rachel:

Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.

Monica:

This woman’s living my life.

Rachel:

What?

Monica:

She’s living my life, and she’s doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I’m intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.

Rachel:

You’re not an artist.

Monica:

Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don’t.

Rachel:

Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.

Monica:

Oh really? Okay, let’s compare, shall we.

Rachel:

(Yawning) Oh, it’s so late for ‘Shall we’…

Monica:

Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?

Rachel:

(Yawning) Nooo…

Monica:

This is so unfair! She’s got everything I want, and she doesn’t have my mother.[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names.]

Chandler:

How about Joey… Pepponi?

Joey:

No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that’s more neutral.

Chandler:

Joey… Switzerland?(The waitress brings their coffee.)

Joey:

Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I’m, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I’m not.

Chandler:

Joe…Joe…Joe…Stalin?

Joey:

Stalin…Stalin…do I know that name? It sounds familiar.

Chandler:

Well, it does not ring a bell with me…

Joey:

(Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that’s pretty good.

Chandler:

Might wanna try Joseph.(Joey visibly thinks 'Of course!’ and writes it down.)

Joey:

Joseph Stalin. I think you’d remember that!

Chandler:

Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel enter.]

Rachel:

Hey.

Phoebe:

Hey.

Monica:

Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I’m taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.

Phoebe:

What are you doing?

Monica:

(Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I’m going to tap class.

Rachel:

What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?

Monica:

This woman’s got my life, I should get to see who she is.

Rachel:

Go to the post office! I’m sure her picture’s up! …Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you’re kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.

Phoebe:

This is madness. It’s madness, I tell you,

for the love of God, Monica, don’t do it

!! …Thank you.[Scene: A Tap Class, the girls are standing at the door.]

Monica:

What d'you think?

Phoebe:

Lotsa things.(They go in and sit down.)

Rachel:

Which one do you think she is?(The teacher comes up to them.)

Teacher:

May I help you?

Monica:

Oh, no thanks, we’re just here to observe.

Teacher: You don’t observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.

Rachel:

What does she mean?

Phoebe: I think she means (Imitates) 'You dance a dance class’. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. (They put on some spare shoes)

Monica:

Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?

Teacher:

(To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let’s not have that happen again!

Rachel:

She could be you.(Music starts)

Teacher:

Let’s get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight…(Everyone starts to dance in unison. Monica flounders)

Monica:

Okay, I’m not getting this!

Phoebe:

(Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I’m totally getting it!

Monica:

Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?(Rachel taps into view; she is in perfect sync with the rest of the class)

Rachel:

What? You just click when they click.

Teacher:

Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.(The girls are unsure how to pair off. Phoebe settles it)

Phoebe:

Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I’m with Rachel.

Monica:

Great. It’s gym class all over again.

Phoebe and

Rachel:

Aww.

Teacher:

Well that’s all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.

Monica:

Why don’t I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.(She starts to walk very slowly toward the front of the room. The teacher grabs her hand and pulls her. Suddenly a woman bursts in)

Woman:

It’s okay, it’s okay, I’m here, I’m here. Sorry I’m late, okay, here I am. Who’s the new tense girl?

Teacher:

She’s your partner.

Woman:

Hi. I’m Monica.

Monica:

Oh. Monica! …Hi. I’m Mo- …nana.

Woman:

(Fake Monica) Monana?

Monica:

Yeah. It’s Dutch.

Fake Monica:

You’re kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her something in Dutch)

Monica:

Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.

Teacher:

And we’re dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight…[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is entering.]

Ross:

(Mortified) Hi.

Chandler and

Joey:

Hey.

Joey:

Where’ve you been?

Ross:

At the vet.

Chandler:

She’s not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?

Ross:

She says Marcel’s humping thing’s not a phase. Apparently he’s reached sexual maturity.

Joey:

(To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.

Ross:

She says as time goes on, he’s gonna start getting agressive and violent.

Chandler:

So what does this mean?

Ross:

I’m gonna have to give him up.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Central Perk, scene continued from earlier.  They guys are sitting there like the Three Monkeys.]

Joey:

I can’t believe it, Ross. This sucks!

Chandler:

I don’t get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?

Ross:

I know. I know. I mean, one day, he’s this little thing, and before you know it, he’s this little thing I can’t get off my leg.

Joey:

Isn’t there any way you can keep him?

Ross:

No, no. The vet says unless he’s in a place where he has regular access to some… monkey lovin,’ he’s just gonna get vicious. I’ve just gotta get him into a zoo.

Joey:

How do you get a monkey into a zoo?

Chandler:

I know that one! …No, that’s Popes into a

Volkswagen

.

Ross:

Well, we’re applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego… right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he’s out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that’s a possibility.

Chandler:

Yeah, but that’s like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it’s a total party zoo.(Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel enters.)

Phoebe:

Hey. We found her, we found the girl.

Chandler:

What?

Joey:

Did you call the cops?

Rachel:

Nope. We took her to lunch.

Chandler:

Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.

Ross:

What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She’s a stealer.

Monica:

Y'know what? After you’re with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.

Ross:

Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.

Chandler:

…Take off their hats!

Phoebe:

Popes in a

Volkswagen

! …I love that joke.[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there.]

Rachel:

No way. No way did you do this.

Fake Monica:

Monana was very brave.

Monica:

It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!

Fake Monica:

So once they caught on to the fact that we’re, y'know, short and have breasts…

Monica:

…They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!

Rachel:

Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don’t know. Don’t wait up. (Exits)

Fake Monica:

Oh, by the way, tomorrow we’re auditioning for a Broadway show.

Monica:

'Scuse me?

Fake Monica:

There’s an open call for Cats. I’m thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?

Monica:

Nononononono. Think who you’re dealing with here. I mean, I’m not like you. I-I can’t even stand in front of a tap class.

Fake Monica:

Well, that’s just probably 'cause of your Amish background.

Monica:

What?

Fake Monica:

Well, you’re Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

Monica:

Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.

Fake Monica:

I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see

Dead Poets’ Society

?

Monica:

Uh-huh.

Fake Monica:

I thought that movie was so incredibly…

boring

. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can’t be in the play? What was that?! It’s like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that’s two hours of my life that I’m never getting back.’ And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.

Monica:

Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend

Mrs. Doubtfire

.[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, tiem lapse.  Everyone but Joey and Monica are there.]

Ross:

(Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn’t get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don’t know who this is harder on, me or him.

Phoebe:

I’d say that chair’s taking the brunt.

Ross:

Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?

Rachel:

Oh, somebody will.

Joey:

(entering) You know there already

is

a Joseph Stalin?

Chandler:

You’re kidding.

Joey:

Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You’d think you would’ve known that!

Chandler:

Y'know, you’d think I would’ve.

Joey:

Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?

Phoebe:

…Flame Boy.[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper.]

Ross:

Where exactly is your zoo?

Dr. Baldhara:

Well, it’s technically not a zoo per se, it’s more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?

Ross:

Yes.

Dr. Baldhara:

Does he, uh, fight with other animals?

Ross:

No-no, he’s, he’s very docile.

Dr. Baldhara:

Even if he were… cornered?

Ross:

Well I, I don’t know. Why?

Dr. Baldhara:

Uh, how is he at handling small objects?

Ross:

He can hold a banana, if that’s whatcha mean…

Dr. Baldhara:

How about a hammer, or a small blade?

Ross:

Why- why- why would he need a blade?

Dr. Baldhara:

Well, if he’s up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you’ve got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it’s just cruel.(Chandler and Joey burst in, with Marcel)

Chandler and

Joey:

He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.

Joey:

We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing…

Chandler:

…He’s in.

Ross:

He’s in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!

Dr. Baldhara:

You’re making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego’s all well and good, but if you give him to me, I’ll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Rachel is dusting. She comes to the table, lifts all the magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. Monica bursts in, obviously drunk.]

Monica:

Yo- hooo!

Rachel:

Where the hell’ve you been?

Monica:

Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.

Rachel:

Are you drunk?!

Monica:

Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I’m lying. I am so drunk.

Rachel:

Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could’ve called, I have been up here, I’ve been worried…(Monica is drinking from the tap)

Rachel:

Monica? Monica!

Monica:

Water rules!

Rachel:

Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you’re gonna be showing up for work?

Monica:

Nope. Going to the

Big Apple Circus

today.

Rachel:

Okay Monica, what are you doing? You’re gonna lose your job! This is not you!

Monica:

No, it is me! Y'know, I’m not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I’m with her, I am so much more than that. I’m- I’m Monana!(The phone rings and Rachel answers)

Rachel:

Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it’s for you, the credit card people.

Monica:

Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.

Rachel:

What?

Monica:

They’ve arrested Monica.[Scene: New York City Department of Correction, Monica is visiting Fake Monica.]

Monica:

Hi.

Fake Monica:

Hey.

Monica:

How are you?

Fake Monica:

I’m not too bad. Fortunately, blue’s my colour. How-how did you know I was here?

Monica:

Because… I’m Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.

Fake Monica:

That I was not expecting.

Monica:

I want you to know, it wasn’t me who turned you in.

Fake Monica:

Oh. Thanks.

Monica:

No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn’t for you, I would never have gotten to sing

Memories

on the stage at the

Wintergarden Theater

!

Fake Monica:

Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-’.

Monica:

I just can’t believe you’re in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who’s gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who’s gonna take me to the

Big Apple Circus

?

Fake Monica:

Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you’re worried about who’s gonna take you to the

Big Apple Circus

?

Monica:

Well, not… worried, just… wondering.

Fake Monica:

There’s nothing to wonder about, Monica. You’re gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that’s who you are.

Monica:

Not necessarily…

Fake Monica:

Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it’s the Amish thing.

Monica:

Um, I’m not actually Amish.

Fake Monica:

Really? Then why are you like that?[Scene: Tap Class, Monica is standing by the door.]

Teacher:

You by the door. In or out?

Monica:

In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)

Teacher:

You in the back, you’re getting it all wrong!

Monica:

Yeah, but at least I’m doing it![Scene: The Airport, everyone but Monica is there to see off Marcel.]

PA:

This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.

Phoebe:

Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don’t eat it 'till you get on the plane.

Ross:

Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.

Phoebe:

Oh!

Chandler:

Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there’s gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there’s also a lot to learn.

Joey:

I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it’s a monkey.

Ross:

Just, just say what you feel.

Joey:

Marcel, I’m hungry.

Ross:

That was good.

Rachel:

(Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It’s, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.

Ross:

Uh, if you guys don’t mind, I’d like to take a moment, just me and him.

All:

Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. (They just stand there, then realise what he means and go to the other end of the room)

Ross:

Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There’s just a coupla things I want to say. I’m really gonna miss you, and I’m never gonna forget about you. You’ve been more than just a pet to me, you’ve been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.(Marcel is put in a cage and taken away.)
